/**
 * Which pages of a chapter are furniture rather than story.
 *
 * The evidence is gathered from the whole SERIES -- a credit page is only recognisable as one because it
 * recurs across chapters -- and then applied to the single chapter being read. See `pageHash.ts` for why
 * the scope is one series and why the threshold is three chapters.
 *
 * ⚠️ A person's decision wins, in both directions, and is never recomputed away. `override = true` marks a
 * page junk that the count never reached (a one-off advert, which by definition appears once and so can
 * never repeat); `override = false` rescues a page the count got wrong. That is the escape hatch that makes
 * an automatic skip safe to turn on: anything it gets wrong can be corrected permanently, by hand, in one
 * tap. Reintroduce by applying the heuristic after the override instead of before, and a page you
 * un-flagged is silently re-flagged on the next run of the hash job.

   * ⚠️ If the rule wants to hide most of a chapter, the rule is wrong about that chapter.
   *
   * Furniture is a credit page and maybe an advert -- on a real library the average is 1.4 pages, and under
   * 6% of all pages. Measured against 7,000 hashed chapters, 3.4% of the chapters that skip anything wanted
   * to skip MORE THAN HALF, and the worst wanted 68 of 88. Those are duplicate and phantom chapters, where
   * the same file is filed several times over, so every page legitimately "recurs across chapters" and the
   * arithmetic is correct while the conclusion is nonsense.
   *
   * There is no way to tell those apart from inside the rule, so the chapter's own shape is the check: a
   * chapter that is mostly furniture is not a chapter. Above a third, the heuristic is discarded entirely
   * and the chapter reads as it always did -- fewer skips, which is the direction this feature is always
   * wrong in. A third is far above any genuine case and well below every misfire measured.
   *
   * A decision made BY HAND is never capped. That is the one source that is not arithmetic, and the whole
   * point of it is that it outranks the rule.
   *
   * Reintroduce by dropping the guard: a chapter whose file is duplicated across the series loses most of
   * its pages, which is the one failure this feature must never have.
