/**
 * Who this device was last signed in as, so the app can open with no network.
 *
 * Launching the installed app in airplane mode used to show the sign-in screen even with chapters sitting
 * in IndexedDB, because two facts were destroyed on every cold boot. The first is in `api.ts`: a 401 and a
 * dead network both came back as `false`, so "the server said no" and "there was no server" were the same
 * answer. The second is this file's reason to exist: `currentUserId` lived only in memory, and
 * `downloads.ts` keys EVERY offline record `${userId}:${bookId}` -- so with nobody signed in, `owner()`
 * returns `'anon'` and every lookup misses. Removing the sign-in screen alone would have produced an empty
 * reader, which is worse than the sign-in screen because it looks like the downloads are gone.
 *
 * ⚠️ THIS RECORD IS NOT A CREDENTIAL, and nothing here should ever make it one. The access token stays in
 * memory (`api.ts`), the refresh token stays in an httpOnly cookie the page cannot read, and every `api()`
 * call still carries the in-memory token or fails. What this grants is exactly one thing: an IndexedDB key
 * prefix -- useful only to somebody who already has that account's blobs on the device, which is to say
 * somebody who already has IndexedDB. It is written only after the SERVER has confirmed who you are, and it
 * is cleared on sign-out and on any rejection.
 *
 * ⚠️ `exp` is advisory. localStorage is editable, so this is not a defence against someone with the device
 * and a debugger; the threat model here is the next person in the household picking the tablet up, and the
 * server remains the enforcement point for everything that touches data. Its job is to stop the grace
 * outliving the session the server would have honoured.
 *
 * WHY localStorage rather than IndexedDB, where the downloads themselves live:
 *   1. It has to be SYNCHRONOUS. `api.ts` explains that `currentUserId` must be answerable without awaiting
 *      anything, because `loadChapter` consults the offline store before any request is in flight. An async
 *      identity leaves a window where `owner()` is `'anon'` -- and an `'anon'` stamp on a queued progress
 *      event is unrecoverable: `downloads.ts` and `sw.js` both skip events whose owner does not match, and
 *      the carve-out for pre-v2 records only forgives an ABSENT owner, not a wrong one.
 *   2. It has to be synchronously CLEARABLE on sign-out. Deleting from IndexedDB can block indefinitely --
 *      that is the entire subject of `offlineBlocked.test.ts` -- and an identity that might not be
 *      deletable on a shared tablet is the leak this file is supposed to prevent.
 *   3. Separate stores fail separately. If identity lived in `yomi-offline`, a blocked upgrade would take
 *      it down too and show the sign-in screen with the downloads sitting right there, unreachable.
 * `i18n.ts`, `device.ts` and `readerPrefs.ts` already mirror server state here for the same first-paint
 * reason, so this is the established pattern rather than a new one.
